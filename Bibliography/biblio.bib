The resolution requirements for the ILC tracking detector are very extreme, demanding very low material in the detector, thus only air cooling can be considered. Power consumption has to be reduced as far as possible. The beam structure of the ILC allows the possibility of power pulsing: only for about the 1 ms long bunch train full power is required, and during the 199 ms long pauses between the bunch trains the power can be reduced to a minimum. Not being adapted for the power pulsing, the sensor shows in laboratory tests a good performance under power pulsing. The power pulsing allows to significantly reduce the heating of the chip and divides power consumption approximately by a factor of 6. In this report a summary of power pulsing studies using the digital readout of Mimosa 26 is given. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the Standard Model (SM) the couplings of the Higgs boson to SM particles and itself (self-couplings) are uniquely specified once the masses of the particles in question as well as the Higgs boson mass are given. Precision measurements of these couplings in the future collider experi-ments are the key to either verifying the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the SM or uncovering physics beyond the SM. This article gives an overview of how various Higgs couplings will be measured at the ILC. Emphasis is put on the ILC's capability of performing fully model independent determination of absolute HZZ and HWW couplings, the Higgs total width, and hence various other Higgs couplings, which cover essentially all the crucial ones in-cluding the top-Yukawa coupling Htt and the trilinear Higgs self-coupling $\lambda$ HHH . The strategy to get the best precision measurements at the ILC is through staged running, which provides many independent $\sigma$ × Br measurements for different production channels and at different energies. A method of global fitting is discussed to utilize all of the available information and to derive combined precisions.},

The precise alignment of this complex device is a formidable challenge, and only achievable with a significant extension of the technologies routinely used for track-ing detectors in the past. This article describes the full-scale alignment procedure as it is used during LHC operations. Among the specific features of the method are the simultaneous determination of up to 200 000 alignment parameters with tracks, the measurement of individual sensor curvature parameters, the control of system-atic misalignment effects, and the implementation of the whole procedure in a multi-processor environment for high execution speed. Overall, the achieved statistical ac-curacy on the module alignment is found to be significantly better than 10 µm.},

@article{Erwin1961,
abstract = {The latter events can be observed only indirectly because neither the K, ' nor the neutron is seen. Figure 2(c) shows the "missing mass" spectrum for events which have a K, ' as the only visible collision product. The events in the KN region of phase space must be corrected for contamina-tion from K, 'K, 'n, {\&}'K'A', {\~{}}'K'Z final states. This was easily done at 1.89 BeV/c since all these reactions have been studied in a previous experi-ment at that momentum. The result shows there were (17+ 8) K, 'K, 'n events and (15+ 7) K K'p events, which compares favorabl. y with the equal number called for by the one-pion-exchange model. Provided the one-pion-exchange model is valid, one may place rather strict limits on the angular momentum of the KK system. Since the G parity of the wv system is even, we have" G =(-1) =+1, where I is the angular momentum of the KK system and I is the isotopic spin. The data in Fig. 2(a) then suggest the low-energy cross section for vm KK is -2 mb for I =0, I =0 K pairs and -0.6 mb for I=1, 1.=1 K pairs. Both cross sections drop to low values for energies of 100 MeV or more above threshold for the KK sys-tem. Eight examples of K+K production [reaction (3) j observed in this experiment were not included in the foregoing analysis. The signature of these events is a charged K+ decay, which is sensitive to the K momentum spectrum. Additional bias may result from the difficulty in distinguishing some of these events from Z+ decays. In our sample of eight events the K+K masses occur in the lower half of phase space in a manner sim-ilar to reaction (1), but the recoil nucleon tends to go forward. This latter observation may indi-cate that not all K pairs are produced in periph-eral collisions. In the course of an experiment at the Brook-haven AGS, we have observed the interaction of high -energy neutrinos with matter. These neutrinos were produced primarily as the result of the decay of the pion: m+ p{\~{}} + (v/v). It is the purpose of this Letter to report some of the results of this experiment including (1) dem-onstration that the neutrinos we have used pro-duce p. mesons but do not produce electrons, and hence are very likely different from the neutrinos involved in P decay and (2) approximate cross sections. Behavior of cross section as a function of en-ergy. The Fermi theory of weak interactions which works well at lom energies implies a cross section for weak interactions which increases as phase space.

@article{Jansen,
abstract = {Test beam measurements at the test beam facilities of DESY have been conducted to characterise the performance of the EUDET-type beam telescopes originally developed within the EUDET project. The beam telescopes are equipped with six sensor planes using MIMOSA 26 monolithic active pixel devices. A programmable Trigger Logic Unit provides trigger logic and time stamp information on particle passage. Both data acquisition framework and offline reconstruction software packages are available. User devices are easily integrable into the data acquisition framework via predefined interfaces. The biased residual distribution is studied as a function of the beam energy, plane spacing and sensor threshold. Its standard deviation at the two centre pixel planes using all six planes for tracking in a 6 GeV electron/positron-beam is measured to be (2.88 ± 0.08) µm. Iterative track fits using the formalism of General Broken Lines are performed to estimate the intrinsic resolution of the individual pixel planes. The mean intrinsic resolution over the six sensors used is found to be (3.24 ± 0.09) µm. With a 5 GeV electron/positron beam, the track resolution halfway between the two inner pixel planes using an equidistant plane spacing of 20 mm is estimated to (1.83 ± 0.03) µm assuming the measured intrinsic resolution. Towards lower beam energies the track resolution deteriorates due to increasing multiple scattering. Threshold studies show an optimal working point of the MIMOSA 26 sensors at a sensor threshold of between five and six times their RMS noise. Measurements at different plane spacings are used to calibrate the amount of multiple scattering in the material traversed and allow for corrections to the predicted angular scattering for electron beams.},

We examine some prop-erties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This " anti-k t " algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split–merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain " iterative cone " algorithm, for which the anti-k t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.},
