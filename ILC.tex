\chapter{The future of high-energy physics: the ILC}

  Since the beginning of the 2000, the high energy physics community is thinking about a future accelerator to work in complement of the LHC.


  Two projects are considered for the future: the ILC and CLIC (far future).
  Due to the purpose of this thesis, only the ILC project will be presented.
