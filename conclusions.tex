This thesis was performed in the context of the \gls{ILC}.
This work addresses is mainly focused on the detector development for \gls{ILD} and gives different steps from the construction of a double-sided vertex detector to the test in real conditions.


Although the physics studied at the \gls{ILC} is presented, the thesis focuses on the detector development and presents different steps of this development.

Firstly, the physics program of the \gls{ILC} was introduced and a physics analysis was presented.


Secondly, the history of the \gls{PLUME} development was presented.
The basic assessments were explained.

Thirdly, the study of the mechanical deformation 

Finally, the radiation length measurement
