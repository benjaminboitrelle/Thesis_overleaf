\chapter{Deformation studies of a ladder under the test beam}

  The first full-scale prototype which embeds twelve sensors glued on a copper flex-cable and a 8 \% density \gls{SiC} foam was tested in November 2011 at CERN-SPS facility with a pions beam of 120 GeV.
  The motivations to perform such a test in real conditions are to, firstly, make sure that the ladder is working properly.
  Secondly, to verify the response homogeneity of each sensor.
  Finally, it has to prove the benefits of a double sided measurement.
  This chapter does not aim to present fully the test beam campaign and all the results, but to focus on a specific study of the ladder's deformation observed during the alignment procedure.
  More results about this test beam is presented in Loic Cousin's thesis\cite{cousin}.
  This chapter will present the test beam facility, as well as the experimental set-up.
  The alignment procedure is explained and some results for the ladder positioned in a normal incidence, as well as the ladder titled in one direction are discussed.
  The second part of the sensor will focus on the deviation observed during the alignment and will discuss a method to overcome these deformations.
  Finally, the benefits of double-sided measurements will be introduced.

  \section{Test beam of the full complete PLUME ladder at CERN}

    \subsection{Test beam facility and beam test set-up}

    The test beam was performed at CERN-SPS in the North hall on the H6 beam line.
    Negative pions with an energy of 120 GeV were used.
    The spill structure is 9.6 s with a dead time of 45.6 s. 
    The bench set-up is composed of 4 standards 120 $\mu\text{m}$ thinned MIMOSA-26 used as telescope planes, the PLUME ladder, called here \gls{DUT} and a $7 \times 7 \text{mm}^2$ used for triggering. 
    The reference planes are at 8 sigma S/N cut and stabilized to a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius.
    The telescope is made of two arms, on each side of the \gls{DUT} and the distance between two sensors of the same arm is 5 mm.
    Nonetheless, for one experimentation, the telescope was set-up differently, as discussed later.
    Most of the runs were taken with a trigger frequency between 2 and 8 kHz except for two days on which it was between 1 and 1.3 kHz.
    As the acquisition system is limited to eight inputs and the set-up has four reference planes, only four sensors of the \gls{DUT} were connected, two on each side.
    Nevertheless, due to the size of the scintillator, the acquisition of sensors outside the beam is not mandatory. 
    Thus, it reduces the data band-with.
    The temperature of the \gls{DUT} was keep stable thanks to a air flow cooling system, provided by a fan.
    Two different air flow speeds were used: 3 $\text{m.s}^{-1}$ and 6 $\text{m.s}^{-1}$. 

    \subsection{Cartesian coordinate systems}

    Two coordinate systems are defined: the global and the local coordinate system.
    The notation used for the global coordinate system is $(x, y, z)$ and is determined by all the sensors of the telescope.
    The $x$ is the horizontal direction, $y$ along the vertical direction and the $z$ is along the beam axis.
    The origin $(0,0,0)$ is of the system is defined with respect to the center of the two reference planes arms.
    The notation $(u, v, w)$ is used for the local coordinate system.
    The $u$ axis corresponds to a sensor row, the $v$ axis is along the pixel columns and the $w$ is perpendicular to the matrix.
    The origin of the local system is in the center of the pixel matrix.
    The figure~\ref{fig:labCoordinates} summarises the definition of the coordinate systems.

    \subsection{Measurements}

    To validate this prototype, different measurements were performed.
    Nevertheless, this chapter will report only one study: the performance of the \gls{DUT} for titled position.
    Measurements were performed with different angles and telescope set-up.
    The first one is represented on the figure~\ref{fig:tilt36} and the angle varies between 28 and 40 degrees.
    Some runs with a larger angle (60 degrees) were done. 
    Due to the limited space between the telescope arm and the size of the \gls{DUT} with the air flow cooling system, the PLUME ladder was positioned outside the two telescope arms, as shown on figure~\ref{fig:tilt60}.

    The analysis and the results shown in the following sections were done thanks to \gls{TAF}, the analysis software developed by the IPHC.

  \section{Spatial resolution studies}
   
    One of the measurement performed during the analysis is to determine the pointing resolution of the ladder.
    The sensors used are well-known and they should have a pointing resolution similar to the one expected, regardless the mechanical structure.
    Any deviations might point out an impact of the mechanical structure on the whole system.
    To get the better understanding, different running conditions were performed: different air flow speed to cool the ladder, different threshold levels and different orientation on of the ladder with respect to the beam.

    \subsection{Normal incidence track}

    Only the hit position is provided by the each sensor.
    To perform an analysis, the telescope planes have to be aligned each other to form tracks from the hit information.
    A track correspond to the path of a particle through the system.
    Thanks to this information, the tracks are then compared to the hit position on the \gls{DUT} to give some information, such as the detection efficiency (the ratio of tracks matched to hits on the \gls{DUT}), the spatial resolution (minimum distance to distinguish two incoming tracks).

    The alignment procedure is done in two steps: firstly the telescope planes are aligned and then the \gls{DUT} is aligned with respect to the information provided by the reference planes. 
    Although the position of each sensors is measured during in the test beam with a precision of the millimeter, for the analysis, a precision of the micron level has to be achieved.
    During the analysis, three degrees of freedom were taken into account for the alignment: two translations for the $x$ and $y$-axes and one rotation around the $z$-axis.
    The $z$ position is here fixed with respect to the measurement performed during the test beam campaign.

      \subsubsection{Alignment procedure}

      Firstly, the data are processed to extract the signal and the hit information.
      The hit is defined as each pixel having a signal above the discriminator thresholds.
      The pixels fired are grouped into cluster.
      As the sensors used have a binary output, no information on the seed pixel is provided.
      Thus, the hit position is obtained from a center of gravity calculation.

      Secondly, the tracks are reconstructed from the hit position.
      One plane is the origin of the global coordinate system and it is generally the first reference plan hit by the beam.
      The track candidates are built perpendicular from the hit found in this first sensor and then extrapolated to the next planes.
      The alignment is an iterative procedure that consists to minimise the residual, or the distance between the track extrapolated to the closest hit on the sensor.
      For example, a track is built from the first reference plane and extrapolated to the last reference plane.
      The residual is minimised and then, a track is defined as straight line connecting one hit on the first plane to a hit on the last plane.
      The sensors in the middle are aligned with respect to this track candidate.
      After the telescope alignment, a track candidate is dismissed if it is made of less than four hits or if the $\chi^2$ fit is greater than a fixed value determined by the user. 

      For the alignment, two assumptions are defined. 
      The telescope planes are parallel each other.
      Thus the alignment consists of a translation along $x$ and $y$ and a rotation around the $z$-axis.
      As the test beam was performed without a magnetic field and pions of 120 GeV were used, the Coulomb multiple scattering is neglected.
      So, the tracks are perpendicular to the detectors and the alignment is not sensitive to the $z$ position.
      A precision of the millimeter level for the position does not have a huge impact on the alignment.

      \subsubsection{Alignment of the DUT}

      When the telescope alignment is done, the reference tracks reconstructed by the reference planes are used to align the \gls{DUT}.
      Its $z$ position is fixed, nonetheless, two degrees for freedom are added: the rotations along the $x$ and $y$-axes, plus the three other degrees of freedom defined above.

    \subsection{Ladder tilted in one direction}

      The same alignment procedure, as presented above, was applied for runs where the ladder was tilted with respect to the beam direction, as shown on the figure~\ref{fig:tilt}.
      Nevertheless, the alignment is more complicated.

    
    This test-beam results have already been discussed (reference to paper and thesis) and results, such as the efficiency or ... are no going to be presented.
