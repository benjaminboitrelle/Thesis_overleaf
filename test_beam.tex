\chapter{Determination of the material budget}

  The discovery of new physics and the characterisation of the already known particles are possible only with good detectors.
  As it was presented on the chapter~\ref{chap:vxd}, the fabrication of a vertex detector is constrained by two parameters: the pointing resolution and the material budget.
  The first fully functional prototype of \gls{PLUME} was tested in November 2011 at CERN with 120 GeV pions.
  The results have shown that the pointing resolution of the ladder is correlating the expected value for the \gls{ILD} and moreover, the use of a double-sided structure improves this pointing resolution. 
  Nevertheless, the material budget ($\rm{X}_0$) of such device is estimated only by calculation and the beam provided by SPS does not allow to measure it.
  Therefore, a test beam campaign was done in April 2016 at DESY test beam 21 with positrons up to 5 GeV.
  The ladder which was tested is also the first prototype (PLUME-V1). 
  The reason to test an already known prototype is that the performances have to be the same at low and high-momentum particles.
  The preparation of the test beam is firstly discussed.
  Then, the test beam facility, as well as the tools used for the analysis are presented.
  Finally, the radiation length measurements are shown.

  %The first fully functional prototype of \gls{PLUME} was tested in November 2011 at CERN with 120 GeV pions. 
  %Due to the environment, the ladder has to be able to track high momentum particles, as well as ones with low momentum.
  %The material budget on the sensitive area for incoming particles is estimated to be about 0.65 \% $X_0$.

  \section{Preparation of the test beam}

   A second test beam was performed in April 2016 at DESY with positrons up to 5 GeV. 
   The goal of this test beam was to study the performances of this device with low-momentum particles.
   The ladder tested is a second PLUME-V1 prototype.
   The steps, from the preparation to the analysis are explained here.
   Different measurements were planned to fully test the ladder.
   Nevertheless, as this test beam was at the end of my Ph. D., I could not perform all the measurements.
   The preparation are presented for all the measurements, but the analysis itself is focused only on the radiation length measurement.

    \subsection{Measurements}

    The test beam last two weeks, hence several measurements were performed to completely test the ladder.
    The measurements scheduled were: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Spatial resolution
      \item Mini-vectors
      \item deformation:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Tilt up to $60^{\degree}$ with a $10^{\degree}$ step
        \item Air flow speed between 3 and $5~\rm{m.s}^{-1}$
      \end{itemize}
      \item radiation length along the sensors and on the mechanical flex
    \end{itemize}

    The pointing resolution of the telescope depend on the spacing between the planes. 
    The best resolution is achieved by placing the inner planes of the telescope as close as possible to the \gls{DUT} and the outer planes as far as possible from the \gls{DUT}.
    %The telescope has a better pointing resolution when the inner planes are very close to the \gls{DUT} and the outer planes are far away from it.
    Nevertheless, to perform the deformation measurements and to tilt the \gls{DUT} without moving the telescope planes at every angle and performing the alignment steps one more time, the two inner planes have a distance of ....
    Moreover, the ladder is not placed in the middle of the box, thus, the distance between one inner telescope plane to the box is different from the distance between the other side and other telescope plane.

    For the first time, the collaboration has decided to use the EUDET telescope and EUDAQ for the acquisition, instead of the Strasbourg telescope and the IPHC acquisition.
    Several solutions were available.
    The first one consists to use the six telescope planes of EUDET and a separate acquisition for \gls{PLUME}.
    As the acquisition is limited to six inputs and the ladder requires at least one sensor on each side to be acquired, a solution to merge the data has to be thought.
    As the EUDET telescope and \gls{PLUME} are equipped with the same sensors, the acquisition can be simplified by having only four telescope planes and connecting directly two sensors of \gls{DUT}.
    A simulation tool was used to define which configuration is giving the best pointing resolution at the \gls{DUT} positions.
    This toolkit was developed by Simon Spannagel and is based on GBL.
    For different energy, the resolution at the PLUME position was calculated for a set-up with four telescope planes and a set-up with six.
    The material budget of the \gls{DUT} is determined by the material budget of \gls{PLUME} plus two kapton foils used to insulate the ladder from light.
    For both configuration, the telescope is made of two arms on each side of the \gls{DUT}.
    With six sensors, the maximal distance between each plane of one frame is $d_{\rm{max}} = 150~\rm{mm}$, whereas for the four sensors configuration it is $d_{\rm{max} = 300~\rm{mm}}$.

    The results shown on figure~\ref{fig:estimationRes4.7GeV} depicts the measured resolution at the position of the \gls{DUT} as a function of the distance between two telescope planes of the same arm.

    \subsection{Acquisition system}
      
      \subsubsection{EUDAQ}

      EUDAQ is a modular cross-platform data acquisition framework developed for the EUDET-type beam telescopes.

      \subsubsection{Hardware}

      A National Instrument PXI crate is used for the data acquisition. 
      A reduction board connected to the crate
      Clock distribution board
      JTAG distribution board

    To ensure the synchronisation of the ladder and the telescope planes, the acquisition is synchronised on the \textit{clock} provided by one of the \gls{PLUME} sensor.
    In the lab, two MIMOSA-26 sensors and the ladder to test are plugged together to the NI-crate. 
    Runs of several hours are launched to verify the synchronisation.
    As the \gls{DUT} and telescope planes are connected to the same \textit{JTAG} card and \textit{clock} distribution board, the start signal arrives at the same time on each sensor.
    If a delay appears, there is a loss in the synchronisation and the acquisition does not work anymore.
    The frame-counter should be the same on each sensor.

    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Software analysis chain}

    The analysis framework used is called EUTelescope\todo{REF TO EUTEL}.
    It is based on the MARLIN framework from the ILCSOFT.
    It handles LCIO data format.
    Each step of the analysis is driven by dedicated processors.

    The first step consists to convert the raw data files into LCIO data format.
    This file contains the pixel number which fired in a given event, along with the sensor number.
    Then, the noisy pixel are removed before to use a cluster algorithm to form sets of cluster from the individual activated pixels.
    From the cluster information, the hit position is determined by a centre-of-gravity 

    The specific acquisition which is done with EUDAQ has complicated the analysis.
    EUTelescope is coded to expect six telescope planes and a or several \gls{DUT} but at different $z$-positions.
    One way to overcome this problem is to perform a biased analysis. 
    Instead of performing the alignment of the telescope and followed by the \gls{DUT} alignment, the procedure can be done in one way.
    Nevertheless, for an unknown reason GBL and Millepede-II are not working.

    A prototype software based on GBL and Millepede-II and written by Claus Kleinwort has permitted to perform the alignment, as well as the other measurements.
    The software reeds a lcio file containing the hit position of every plane.

    Due to the specific acquisition which was done with EUDAQ, the analysis was a bit complicated.
    EUTelescope was coded to expect six telescope planes plus a single DUT.
    One way to overcome this problem was to perform a biased analysis.
    Instead of performing the alignment of the telescopes and then the DUT for an analysis, this step has to be done in one way.
    Nevertheless, the alignment procedure was not working.

    To perform the alignment, I have used a python script written by Claus Kleinwort, which reads the hit position of every sensor and use GBL and MP-II to perform the alignment.

  \section{Measuring the radiation length}

    \subsection{Motivation}

    The material budget of a detector is an important aspect during its design, specifically in the tracking system.
    The detector should be able to detect a particle without degrading its energy to leave the measurement to the calorimeter.
    The radiation length is the mean distance a charged particle loss $1/e$ of its energy.

    \subsection{The DESY II test beam facility}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item LINAC: generation of the beam
      \item DESY-II: synchrotron ring (storage ring for PETRA)
      \item PETRA: synchrotron ring used for photon science
    \end{itemize}
